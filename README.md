  - cleaned up function naming and how the function where bound to the game var vs this
  - moved/rewrote some code to make it more readable 
  - renamed a few functions to be more descriptive
  - added comments to make the code clearer to navigate
  - added a max amount of player which is configurable
  - created some more indepth tests
  - added more user feedback messages to make clear where the players stand
    - player amount
    - show when there is a winner
